# Technical Research Story: Authentication Implementation Research

**Type**: Developer Story
**Labels**: technical-debt, research
**Priority**: High
**Story Points**: 3

**As a** developer
**I need** to research and evaluate authentication solutions for React/Express
**So that** we can implement secure user authentication that scales

### Research Objectives
* Authentication strategies:
    - JWT vs Session-based
    - OAuth integration possibilities
    - Secure token storage methods
* Security considerations:
    - CSRF protection
    - XSS prevention
    - Password hashing (bcrypt)
* Implementation patterns:
    - React Context vs Redux
    - Express middleware setup
    - Protected route patterns

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Scenario: Authentication Strategy Decision
  Given the research is completed
  When reviewing authentication options
  Then document pros/cons of each approach
  And recommend specific implementation strategy

Scenario: Security Requirements
  Given security best practices are reviewed
  When documenting authentication flow
  Then include all required security measures
  And document potential vulnerabilities

Scenario: Implementation Plan
  Given the strategy is selected
  When creating implementation plan
  Then include specific libraries/tools
  And provide example code snippets
